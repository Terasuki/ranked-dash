# Ranked Stats Dashboard

Link to the online dashboard: https://ranked-dash-app.onrender.com/. Currently using a free Render instance so please be patient with filters and so.

Dashboard made with Plotly Dash. Contains global statistics about [AMQ](https://animemusicquiz.com/) Ranked, with an option to include personal ones as well.

Note, currently the only data available are games where I (TrueXC) play (e.g. I collect the data myself).
